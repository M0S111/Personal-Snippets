##Function Definition: def min_operations(n): This line defines the function min_operations which takes one argument n, the number you want to reach starting from 1.
##Initialize the List of Operations: ops = [0] * (n + 1) This line creates a list ops of length n + 1, filled with zeros. Each element in this list will eventually hold the minimum number of operations needed to reach the corresponding index number from 1.
##Initialize the List of Sequences: sequence = [[0] for _ in range(n + 1)] and sequence[1] = [1] These lines create a list of lists sequence of length n + 1, where each sublist will eventually hold the sequence of numbers reached using the minimum number of operations to get to the corresponding index number from 1. The sequence for 1 is just [1].
##Calculate Minimum Operations and Sequences: The for loop for i in range(2, n + 1): iterates over each number from 2 to n. For each number i, it calculates the minimum number of operations needed to reach i from 1 and the corresponding sequence of numbers. It does this by checking three possibilities: adding 1 to i - 1, multiplying i // 2 by 2, and multiplying i // 3 by 3. For each possibility, it checks if the number of operations is less than the current minimum number of operations for i. If it is, it updates the minimum number of operations and the corresponding sequence.
##Return the Sequence for n: return sequence[n] Finally, the function returns the sequence of numbers for n, which is the sequence reached using the minimum number of operations to get from 1 to n.
